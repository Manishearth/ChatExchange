ChatExchange
============

[![Github Actions build status for master](https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange/actions/workflows/lint+test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Manishearth/ChatExchange/actions)

A Python2 and Python3 cross-version API for talking to Stack Exchange chat.

 - Supported Python versions (Travis CI build run for each of these):  
    `2.7`, `3.4`, `3.5`, `3.6`, `3.7-dev`, `nightly` 
 - Unclear versions (not run on Travis CI as `pytest` does not support them):
    `2.6`, `3.2`, `3.3`

## Dependencies
**Make sure you use either `pip2` or `pip3` depending on which Python version you want to run this on.**


 - BeautifulSoup (`pip install beautifulsoup4`)
 - Requests (`pip install requests`). Usually there by default. Please upgrade it with `pip install requests --upgrade`  
   *Note that Ubuntu comes with an old version of `pip` that is not compatible any more with the latest version of `requests`. It will be broken after you installed `requests`, except if you update it before (or afterwards) with `easy_install pip` or `pip install --upgrade pip` (that one works only before).*
 - python-websockets for the experimental websocket listener (`pip install websocket-client`). This module is optional, without it `initSocket()` from SEChatBrowser will not work

The package has a number of additional development requirements;
install them with

    pip install chatexchange[dev]

or `.[dev]` if you are in the top directory of a local copy of the source.

## Shortcuts

1. `make install-dependencies` will install the necessary Python package dependencies into your current environment (active virtualenv or system site packages)
2. `make test` will run the tests
3. `make run-example` will run the example script
4. `make` will run the above three in order
